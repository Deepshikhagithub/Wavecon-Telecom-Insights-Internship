# Welcome to the Wavecon 5G Analysis!

In this Readme, I, Manisha Deepshikha Patra, a junior data analyst, provide a concise overview of the dataset and the task undertaken as part of my mission. My mission is twofold:

1. Create a comprehensive comparison report of key performance indicators (KPIs) between the pre and post-launch periods of Wavecon's 5G services, aiding the top-level management in making informed decisions to recover active user rates and enhance other vital metrics.

2. Provide a video presentation on the virtual internship dashboard of Wavecon Telecom and offer the required insights through the presentation.

This journey involves exploring data, extracting meaningful insights, and presenting them effectively. I'm excited to share the valuable insights gathered during this virtual internship. Stay tuned for the full presentation, which will help us navigate the dynamic world of telecommunications and data analysis.
